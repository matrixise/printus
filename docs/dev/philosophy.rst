Development Philosophy
----------------------

Values
~~~~~~

- Simplicity is always better than functionality.
- Listen to everyone, then disregard it.
- The API is all that matters. Everything else is secondary.

Semantic Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many years, the open source community has been plagued with version number
dystonia. Numbers vary so greatly from project to project, they are practically
meaningless.

PrintUs uses `Sematic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_. This specification seeks
to put an end to this madness with a small set of practical guidelines for you
and your colleagues to use in your next project.
